# Why did we choose this project as a Minecraft client?

> Our founder, [Eclipse](https://eclipsethedev.github.io/AboutMe/), choose a Minecraft client to invest in because
1. It is a project that will continue untill we die, get forgotten, don't know how to code or other complications
2. If one of those complications arise then other versions will still be download-able
