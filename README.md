# The Unknown Client
## Founder

> The founders name is Eclipse.
> You can see more about them [here](https://eclipsethedev.github.io/AboutMe/)

## Why did we choose this project as a Minecraft client?

> Our founder, [Eclipse](https://eclipsethedev.github.io/AboutMe/), choose a Minecraft client to invest in because
```
1. It is a project that will continue untill we die, get forgotten, don't know how to code or other complications
2. If one of those complications arise then other versions will still be download-able
```

## How to set it up

> Just run the TheUnknownClient.exe (+ bro we just made this, it is still in development)

## Why choose The Unknown Client if it not a thing yet?

> I believe you should keep using the client you are using untill we release the beta version

## Will there be beta testers?

> No, The version will be released to everyone

## Do you have a release date?

> No, but we are planing to release it mid/late 2023
